Currently hithertunes can make an iTunes library streamable across the web.  It'll run on a mac with just a couple dependencies.


INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
--------------------
cherrypy (3.1.2): http://download.cherrypy.org/cherrypy/3.1.2/CherryPy-3.1.2.tar.gz
mako (0.3.6): http://www.makotemplates.org/downloads/Mako-0.3.6.tar.gz
pyitunes (current): git clone git://github.com/liamks/pyitunes.git

For each of these 3 python packages, run the following to install:
  $ sudo python setup.py install


RUN THE SERVER
--------------
To start up the server on localhost port 8085, just run the following script:
  # python hithertunes.py


IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
-----------------------
Read the console output; I tried to make it verbose enough to be actually useful.  Otherwise just bug rcrowell about it.
